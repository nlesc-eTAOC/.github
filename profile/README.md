The (e)-Tipping of the Atlantic Ocean Circulation (eTAOC) is a project of the IMAU at University of Utrecht and the Netherland eScience Center (NLeSC). The primary objective is to use rare event algorithms to predict the probability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transitioning from its current state to a collapsed state by 2100.
